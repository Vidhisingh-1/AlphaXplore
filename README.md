# AlphaXplore 🔤📱✨

**AlphaXplore** is an Augmented Reality (AR) web app that makes alphabet learning fun, interactive, and immersive — especially for young learners.

Using your device’s camera, simply show printed or digital markers for letters A–Z, and AlphaXplore will display a 3D object (like an 🍎 for "A") along with audio that says the phrase (“A for Apple”).
