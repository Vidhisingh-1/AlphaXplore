# Alphabet_recognition
This is an Augmented Reality (AR) project designed to make learning the English alphabet engaging and interactive for children. Using AR markers and 3D models, users can visualize and interact with objects associated with each letter of the alphabet.

TECHNOLOGY-STACK:
HTML, JavaScript: For creating the user interface and implementing AR.js functionalities.                                                                              
AR.js: A lightweight library for marker-based augmented reality.                                                                                                        
A-Frame: For rendering 3D objects and scenes.                                                                                                                         
GLTF Models: Used for high-quality 3D representations of objects.
